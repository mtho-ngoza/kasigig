service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    // Users can read and write their own data
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
      allow read: if request.auth != null; // Allow others to read basic profile info
    }

    // Gigs are readable by all authenticated users
    match /gigs/{gigId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.employerId;
    }

    // Applications
    match /applications/{applicationId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null &&
        (request.auth.uid == resource.data.applicantId ||
         request.auth.uid == resource.data.employerId);
    }

    // Reviews
    match /reviews/{reviewId} {
      allow read: if request.auth != null;
      allow write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == resource.data.reviewerId;
    }
  }
}
